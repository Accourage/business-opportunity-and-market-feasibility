# Terms
The term that refers to all parties that participate in the marketplace are called __Users__. There are two types of users; __Customers__ and __Providers__.

A __Customer__ is a __User__ that spends currency on the marketplace for a good or service.

A __Provider__ is a __User__ that sells their goods or services on the marketplace.

A __Transaction__ is a single exchange of currency for a good or service. __Transactions__ have __Lifetimes__ that determine when the currency will be released from escrow. The lifetime of a transaction is agreed upon by the Users involved before it is initiated.

# Value to Users
Accourage will act as a reputable marketplace for connecting Customers to Providers for any task imaginable. A rating system managed by the Accourage marketplace allows Customers to rate Providers on the service or product they provide. Providers are also allowed to rate Customers to indicate to other Users the trustworthiness of the Customer. The marketplace features strong search capabalities, allowing Customers to find what they need when they want it. As a marketplace, anti-fraud and escrow services are required for all transactions, giving Customers and Providers peace of mind when interacting with new Users.

## Access
Customers and Providers are able to access the entire marketplace from a Phone, Tablet, Desktop, or Web capable device. 

# Value to Accourage
## Transaction Fees
Accourage applies a fee to each transaction. Users are incentivized to behave well, as their rating determines the fee they pay per transaction. Users with a consistent history of poor reviews will end up paying much more in fees than Users with good ratings.

## Data
Users on the Accourage marketplace will be required to allow Accourage to collect data about their transactions for internal use only. Accourage will use this data to predict trends in transactions, target types of transactions for more appropriate base fees, more effectively utilize infrastructure, and effectively order global search results. Accourage will not use this data for advertisment targeting.

By utilizing the data collected to dynamically change base fees, a larger overall cashflow can be achieved.
